	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am studying Biomedical Engineering in my 1A term at the University of Waterloo, and loving every minute of it. 
	I am particularly interested in the design of prosthetics, which I was introduced to as part of my involvement with 
	Biomechatronics Club. I would also love to learn more about medical device manufacturing and "bio-hacking". In my spare
	time, I like to practice Vinyasa yoga and write short stories.</p>
